Needs python 3.x

Install modules:
pip install behave getpass yaml hvac psutil 

Run tests with behave (not implemented)

Processes:
---------
orch: Process called by cron to tell the daemon to run a program

orchd: Daemon process that connects to the vault at startup and maintains that
connection. Orchd reads the credentials to connect to the vault at startup time.
This prevents it being stored on disk.

orchestrate.yaml: Configuration file read by orchd. This includes primarily the
configuration information for each command that should be run.
